### This file sets up tab completion. You do not need to do this to use scd directory pattern mattching fuctionality.
# This feature is EXPERIMENTAL

##Setup a directory root you'd like to search

export logdir=~/Documents/logs

##bash completion for above directory

function lcd(){ scd $logdir $@; }
_lcd(){ gcomp $logdir; }
complete -F _lcd lcd

# Now typing `lcd <tab>` will give you a list of directories in that dir. You can even do `lcd test/old_tests/ <tab> ` to see dirs in $logdir/test/old_tests if you want.
